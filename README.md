Overview
---
<p>This is a small CLI application using Java and MySQL. I could have chosen almost any domain, but decided on order management due to the straight forward relationships. It took me just 3 days to get the application developed from front to end, which includes a db schema, multi-tier Java application with DAOs, Services, Domain objects, Controllers, and a CLI user interface. I plan on using this project to learn more technologies.</p>
